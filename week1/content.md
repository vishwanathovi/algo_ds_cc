## Expected Learning
* How different data structures are stored in the memory
* Basic understand of recursion
* Getting comformable with problem solving with basic problem sets


## Learning links
### Data Structure & RAM

### Recursion
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-recursions/
https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2021/03/types-of-recursion.html

Also, think about passing data in recursion using
* Global variable
* Passing through function parameters
* passing through return of the function


## Problems 
### Array

### Recursion
1. Implement a function to give factorial of a number using recursion
2. Implement a function to give nth fibonacci number - (Read about memoization & try to implement it in the second iteration)
3. Write a recursion program that prints values of array from left to right
4. Write a recursion program that prints values of array from right to left
